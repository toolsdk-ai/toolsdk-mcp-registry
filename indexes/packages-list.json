Start with an initial estimate of needed thoughts, but be ready to adjust\n2. Feel free to question or revise previous thoughts\n3. Don't hesitate to add more thoughts if needed, even at the \"end\"\n4. Express uncertainty when present\n5. Mark thoughts that revise previous thinking or branch into new paths\n6.

        "description": "\nA detailed tool for dynamic and reflective problem-solving through thoughts.\n\nThis tool helps analyze problems through a flexible thinking process that can adapt and evolve.\nEach thought can build on, question, or revise previous insights as understanding deepens.\nIt uses an Agno multi-agent team (in coordinate mode) to process each thought, where a\nCoordinator delegates sub-tasks to specialists (Planner, Researcher, Analyzer, Critic, Synthesizer)\nand synthesizes their outputs.\n\nWhen to use this tool:\n- Breaking down complex problems into manageable steps.\n- Planning and design processes requiring iterative refinement and revision.\n- Complex analysis where the approach might need course correction based on findings.\n- Problems where the full scope or optimal path is not clear initially.\n- Situations requiring a multi-step solution with context maintained across steps.\n- Tasks where focusing on relevant information and filtering out noise is crucial.\n- Developing and verifying solution hypotheses through a chain of reasoning.\n\nKey features & usage guidelines:\n- The process is driven by the caller (e.g., an LLM) making sequential calls to this tool.\n- Start with an initial estimate for `totalThoughts`, but adjust it dynamically via subsequent calls if needed.\n- Use `isRevision=True` and `revisesThought` to explicitly revisit and correct previous steps.\n- Use `branchFromThought` and `branchId` to explore alternative paths or perspectives.\n- If the estimated `totalThoughts` is reached but more steps are needed, set `needsMoreThoughts=True` on the *last* thought within the current estimate to signal the need for extension.\n- Express uncertainty and explore alternatives within the `thought` content.\n- Generate solution hypotheses within the `thought` content when appropriate.\n- Verify hypotheses in subsequent `thought` steps based on the reasoning chain.\n- The caller should repeat the process, calling this tool for each step, until a satisfactory solution is reached.\n- Set `nextThoughtNeeded=False` only when the caller determines the process is complete and a final answer is ready.\n\nParameters:\n    thought (str): The content of the current thinking step. This can be an analytical step,\n                   a plan, a question, a critique, a revision, a hypothesis, or verification.\n                   Make it specific enough to imply the desired action.\n    thoughtNumber (int): The sequence number of this thought (>=1). Can exceed initial `totalThoughts`\n                         if the process is extended.\n    totalThoughts (int): The current *estimate* of the total thoughts required for the process.\n                         This can be adjusted by the caller in subsequent calls. Minimum 5 suggested.\n    nextThoughtNeeded (bool): Indicates if the caller intends to make another call to this tool\n                              after the current one. Set to False only when the entire process is deemed complete.\n    isRevision (bool, optional): True if this thought revises or corrects a previous thought. Defaults to False.\n    revisesThought (int, optional): The `thoughtNumber` of the thought being revised, required if `isRevision` is True.\n                                    Must be less than the current `thoughtNumber`.\n    branchFromThought (int, optional): The `thoughtNumber` from which this thought branches to explore an alternative path.\n                                       Defaults to None.\n    branchId (str, optional): A unique identifier for the branch being explored, required if `branchFromThought` is set.\n                              Defaults to None.\n    needsMoreThoughts (bool, optional): Set to True on a thought if the caller anticipates needing more\n                                        steps beyond the current `totalThoughts` estimate *after* this thought.\n                                        Defaults to False.\n\nReturns:\n    str: The Coordinator agent's synthesized response based on specialist contributions for the current `thought`.\n         Includes guidance for the caller on potential next steps (e.g., suggestions for revision or branching\n         based on the specialists' analysis). The caller uses this response to formulate the *next* thought.\n"

Script Source (Choose one):**\n*   `kb_script_id` (string): **Preferred.** Executes a pre-defined script from the knowledge base by its ID. Use `get_scripting_tips` to find IDs and inputs. Supports placeholder substitution via `input_data` or `arguments`. Ex: `kb_script_id: \"safari_get_front_tab_url\"`.\n*   `script_content` (string): Executes raw AppleScript/JXA code. Good for simple or dynamic scripts. Ex: `script_content: \"tell application \\\"Finder\\\" to empty trash\"`.\n*   `script_path` (string): Executes a script from an absolute POSIX path on the server. Ex: `/Users/user/myscripts/myscript.applescript`.\n\n**2. Script Inputs (Optional):**\n*   `input_data` (JSON object): For `kb_script_id`, provides named inputs (e.g., `--MCP_INPUT:keyName`). Values (string, number, boolean, simple array/object) are auto-converted. Ex: `input_data: { \"folder_name\": \"New Docs\" }`.\n*   `arguments` (array of strings): For `script_path` (passes to `on run argv` / `run(argv)`). For `kb_script_id`, used for positional args (e.g., `--MCP_ARG_1`).\n\n**3. Execution Options (Optional):**\n*   `language` ('applescript' | 'javascript'): Specify for `script_content`/`script_path` (default: 'applescript'). Inferred for `kb_script_id`.\n*   `timeout_seconds` (integer, optional, default: 60): Sets the maximum time (in seconds) the script is allowed to run. Increase for potentially long-running operations.\n*   `output_format_mode` (enum, optional, default: 'auto'): Controls `osascript` output formatting.\n    *   `'auto'`: Smart default - resolves to `'human_readable'` for AppleScript and `'direct'` for JXA.\n    *   `'human_readable'`: For AppleScript, uses `-s h` flag.\n    *   `'structured_error'`: For AppleScript, uses `-s s` flag (structured errors).\n    *   `'structured_output_and_error'`: For AppleScript, uses `-s ss` flag (structured output & errors).\n    *   `'direct'`: No special output flags (recommended for JXA).\n*   `include_executed_script_in_output` (boolean, optional, default: false): If `true`, the final script content (after any placeholder substitutions) or script path that was executed will be included in the response. This is useful for debugging and understanding exactly what was run. Defaults to false.\n*   `include_substitution_logs` (boolean, default: false): For `kb_script_id`, includes detailed placeholder substitution logs.\n*   `report_execution_time` (boolean, optional, default: false): If `true`, an additional message with the formatted script execution time will be included in the response.

This tool is essential for discovery and should be the FIRST CHOICE when aiming to automate macOS tasks, especially those involving common applications or system functions, before attempting to write scripts from scratch. It helps identify pre-built, tested solutions, effectively teaching you how to control virtually any aspect of your macOS experience.\n\n**Primary Use Cases & Parameters:**\n\n*   **Discovering Solutions (Use `search_term`):**\n    *   Parameter: `search_term` (string, optional).\n    *   Functionality: Performs a fuzzy search across all tip titles, descriptions, keywords, script content, and IDs. Ideal for natural language queries like \"how to...\" (e.g., `search_term: \"how do I get the current Safari URL and title?\"`). This is the most common way to find relevant tips.\n    *   Output: Returns a list of matching tips in Markdown format.\n\n*   **Limiting Search Results (Use `limit`):**\n    *   Parameter: `limit` (integer, optional, default: 10).\n    *   Functionality: Specifies the maximum number of script tips to return when using `search_term` or browsing a specific `category` (without `list_categories: true`). Does not apply if `list_categories` is true.\n\n*   **Browsing by Category (Use `category`):**\n    *   Parameter: `category` (string, optional).\n    *   Functionality: Shows tips from a specific category. Combine with `limit` to control result count.\n    *   Example: `category: \"01_intro\"` or `category: \"07_browsers/chrome\"`.\n\n*   **Listing All Categories (Use `list_categories: true`):**\n    *   Parameter: `list_categories` (boolean, optional).\n    *   Functionality: Returns a structured list of all available categories with their descriptions. This helps you understand what automation areas are covered.\n    *   Output: Category tree in Markdown format.\n\n*   **Refreshing Database (Use `refresh_database: true`):**\n    *   Parameter: `refresh_database` (boolean, optional).\n    *   Functionality: Forces a reload of the knowledge base if new scripts have been added. Typically not needed as the database refreshes automatically.\n\n**Best Practices:**\n1. **Always start with search**: Use natural language queries to find solutions (e.g., \"send email from Mail app\").\n2. **Browse categories when exploring**: Use `list_categories: true` to see available automation areas.\n3. **Use specific IDs for execution**: Once you find a script, use its ID with `execute_script` tool for precise execution."

Apply any combination of filters (tags, lists, folders, spaces, statuses, etc.)\n2. Use pagination to manage large result sets\n3. Include subtasks by setting subtasks=true\n\nRequirements:\n- At least one filter parameter is REQUIRED (tags, list_ids, folder_ids, space_ids, statuses, assignees, or date filters)\n- Pagination parameters (page, order_by, reverse) alone are not considered filters\n\nNotes:\n- Provides workspace-wide task access (unlike get_tasks which only searches in one list)\n- Returns complete task details including descriptions, assignees, custom fields, and all metadata\n- Tag filtering is especially useful for cross-list organization (e.g., \"project-x\", \"blocker\", \"needs-review\")\n- Combine multiple filters to narrow down your search scope\n- Use pagination for large result sets\n- Set subtasks=true to include subtask details in the response\n  IMPORTANT: subtasks=true enables subtasks to appear in results, but subtasks must still match your other filter criteria (tags, lists, etc.) to be returned. To see all subtasks of a specific task regardless of filters, use the get_task tool with subtasks=true instead.\n- Use the detail_level parameter to control the amount of data returned:\n  - \"summary\": Returns lightweight task data (name, status, list, tags)\n  - \"detailed\": Returns complete task data with all fields (DEFAULT if not specified)\n- Responses exceeding 50,000 tokens automatically switch to summary format to avoid hitting LLM token limits\n- **Enhanced List Filtering**: When list_ids are provided, the tool leverages ClickUp's Views API to include tasks that are *associated with* the specified lists, including tasks that have been added to multiple lists. This provides comprehensive coverage of all tasks related to your specified lists, not just tasks that were originally created in those lists.\n"

        "description": "# Instructions\n1. Query Axiom datasets using Axiom Processing Language (APL). The query must be a valid APL query string.\n2. ALWAYS get the schema of the dataset before running queries rather than guessing.\n    You can do this by getting a single event and projecting all fields.\n3. Keep in mind that there's a maximum row limit of 65000 rows per query.\n4. Prefer aggregations over non aggregating queries when possible to reduce the amount of data returned.\n5. Be selective in what you project in each query (unless otherwise needed, like for discovering the schema).\n    It's expensive to project all fields.\n6. ALWAYS restrict the time range of the query to the smallest possible range that\n    meets your needs. This will reduce the amount of data scanned and improve query performance.\n7. NEVER guess the schema of the dataset. If you don't where something is, use search first to find in which fields\n    it appears.\n\n# Examples\nBasic:\n- Filter: ['logs'] | where ['severity'] == \"error\" or ['duration'] > 500ms\n- Time range: ['logs'] | where ['_time'] > ago(2h) and ['_time'] < now()\n- Project rename: ['logs'] | project-rename responseTime=['duration'], path=['url']\n\nAggregations:\n- Count by: ['logs'] | summarize count() by bin(['_time'], 5m), ['status']\n- Multiple aggs: ['logs'] | summarize count(), avg(['duration']), max(['duration']), p95=percentile(['duration'], 95) by ['endpoint']\n- Dimensional: ['logs'] | summarize dimensional_analysis(['isError'], pack_array(['endpoint'], ['status']))\n- Histograms: ['logs'] | summarize histogram(['responseTime'], 100) by ['endpoint']\n- Distinct: ['logs'] | summarize dcount(['userId']) by bin_auto(['_time'])\n\nSearch & Parse:\n- Search all: search \"error\" or \"exception\"\n- Parse logs: ['logs'] | parse-kv ['message'] as (duration:long, error:string) with (pair_delimiter=\",\")\n- Regex extract: ['logs'] | extend errorCode = extract(\"error code ([0-9]+)\", 1, ['message'])\n- Contains ops: ['logs'] | where ['message'] contains_cs \"ERROR\" or ['message'] startswith \"FATAL\"\n\nData Shaping:\n- Extend & Calculate: ['logs'] | extend duration_s = ['duration']/1000, success = ['status'] < 400\n- Dynamic: ['logs'] | extend props = parse_json(['properties']) | where ['props.level'] == \"error\"\n- Pack/Unpack: ['logs'] | extend fields = pack(\"status\", ['status'], \"duration\", ['duration'])\n- Arrays: ['logs'] | where ['url'] in (\"login\", \"logout\", \"home\") | where array_length(['tags']) > 0\n\nAdvanced:\n- Make series: ['metrics'] | make-series avg(['cpu']) default=0 on ['_time'] step 1m by ['host']\n- Join: ['errors'] | join kind=inner (['users'] | project ['userId'], ['email']) on ['userId']\n- Union: union ['logs-app*'] | where ['severity'] == \"error\"\n- Fork: ['logs'] | fork (where ['status'] >= 500 | as errors) (where ['status'] < 300 | as success)\n- Case: ['logs'] | extend level = case(['status'] >= 500, \"error\", ['status'] >= 400, \"warn\", \"info\")\n\nTime Operations:\n- Bin & Range: ['logs'] | where ['_time'] between(datetime(2024-01-01)..now())\n- Multiple time bins: ['logs'] | summarize count() by bin(['_time'], 1h), bin(['_time'], 1d)\n- Time shifts: ['logs'] | extend prev_hour = ['_time'] - 1h\n\nString Operations:\n- String funcs: ['logs'] | extend domain = tolower(extract(\"://([^/]+)\", 1, ['url']))\n- Concat: ['logs'] | extend full_msg = strcat(['level'], \": \", ['message'])\n- Replace: ['logs'] | extend clean_msg = replace_regex(\"(password=)[^&]*\", \"\\1***\", ['message'])\n\nCommon Patterns:\n- Error analysis: ['logs'] | where ['severity'] == \"error\" | summarize error_count=count() by ['error_code'], ['service']\n- Status codes: ['logs'] | summarize requests=count() by ['status'], bin_auto(['_time']) | where ['status'] >= 500\n- Latency tracking: ['logs'] | summarize p50=percentile(['duration'], 50), p90=percentile(['duration'], 90) by ['endpoint']\n- User activity: ['logs'] | summarize user_actions=count() by ['userId'], ['action'], bin(['_time'], 1h)"

IMPORTANT: (1) Before using this tool, you must first get the file's current hash and range hashes and line numbers using get_text_file_contents. (2) To avoid line number shifts affecting your patches, use get_text_file_contents to read the SAME ranges you plan to edit before making changes. different line numbers have different rangehashes.(3) Patches must be specified from bottom to top to handle line number shifts correctly, as edits to lower lines don't affect the line numbers of higher lines. (4) To append content to a file, first get the total number of lines with get_text_file_contents, then specify a patch with line_start = total_lines + 1 and line_end = total_lines. This indicates an append operation and range_hash is not required. Similarly, range_hash is not required for new file creation."

Extract and combine key information from multiple results\n2. Consider the source and relevance score when evaluating information\n3. Use follow-up queries to clarify ambiguous or incomplete information\n4. If the response is not relevant, try a different query, knowledge base, and/or data source\n5. After a few attempts, ask the user for clarification or a different query.\n"

This tool will programmatically extract all translations into a structured JSON file, preserving nested objects, arrays, template variables, and formatting. This helps keep translations as configuration and prevents filling up the AI context window with translation content. By default, the source file will be replaced with \"MIGRATED TO <target absolute path>\" and a warning message after successful extraction, making it easy to track where the data was moved to. This behaviour can be disabled by setting the DISABLE_SOURCE_REPLACEMENT environment variable to 'true'. The warning message can be customized by setting the WARNING_MESSAGE environment variable."

Manual pagination: First request with limit=N, then use the returned 'next_offset' tokens in subsequent requests\n3. Tips for large projects: Specify only needed fields, set include_subtasks=false if subtasks aren't needed\n\nEXAMPLES:\n- For all data: {project_id:\"123\", auto_paginate:true}\n- For first page: {project_id:\"123\", limit:10}\n- For next page: {project_id:\"123\", limit:10, offset:\"eyJ0a...\"}\n- For deep subtasks: {project_id:\"123\", include_subtasks:true, max_subtask_depth:3}\nNote: offset must be a token from previous response (section.pagination_info.next_offset)"

Read more about [tags](https://docs.inkdrop.app/manual/write-notes#tag-notes).\n- **status**  \n  `status:onHold`: Searches for all notes with the 'On hold' status. Read more about [statuses](/reference/note-statuses).\n- **title**  \n  `title:\"JavaScript setTimeout\"`: Searches for the note with the specified title.\n- **body**  \n  `body:KEYWORD`: Searches for a specific word in all notes. Equivalent to a [global search](#search-for-notes-across-all-notebooks).\n\n### Combine qualifiers\n\nYou can combine the filter qualifiers to refine data even more.\n\n**Find notes that contain the word 'Hello' and have the 'Issue' tag.**\n\n```text\nHello tag:Issue\n```\n\n**Find notes that contain the word 'Typescript,' have the 'Contribution' tag, and the 'Completed' status**\n\n```text\nTypescript tag:Contribution status:Completed\n```\n\n## Search for text with spaces\n\nTo find the text that includes spaces, put the text into the double quotation marks (\"):\n\n```text\n\"database associations\"\n```\n\n## Exclude text from search\n\nTo exclude text from the search results or ignore a specific qualifier, put the minus sign (-) before it. You can also combine the exclusions. See the examples:\n\n- `-book:Backend \"closure functions\"`: Ignores the 'Backend' notebook while searching for the 'closure functions' phrase.\n- `-tag:JavaScript`: Ignores all notes having the 'JavaScript' tag.\n- `-book:Typescript tag:work \"Data types\"`: Ignores the 'Typescript' notebook and the 'work' tag while searching for the 'Data types' phrase.\n- `-status:dropped title:\"Sprint 10.0\" debounce`: Ignores notes with the 'Dropped' status while searching for the 'debounce' word in the note with the 'Sprint 10.0' title.\n- `-\"Phrase to ignore\" \"in the rest of a sentence\"`: Ignores the 'Phrase to ignore' part while searching for 'in the rest of a sentence'.\n\nNote that you can't specify excluding modifiers only without including conditions.\n\n**WARNING**: Make sure to enter a text to search for after the exclusion modifier.\n\n- ✅ Will work  \n  `-book:Backend \"closure functions\"`\n\n- ⛔️ Won't work  \n   `-book:Backend`. There's no query. Inkdrop doesn't understand what to search for.\n    "

        "description": "Register a new user request and plan its associated tasks. You must provide 'originalRequest' and 'tasks', and optionally 'splitDetails'.\n\nTasks can now include subtasks, which are smaller units of work that make up a task. All subtasks must be completed before a task can be marked as done.\n\nYou can also include:\n- 'dependencies': List of project or task-specific dependencies (libraries, tools, etc.)\n- 'notes': General notes about the project (preferences, guidelines, etc.)\n- 'outputPath': Path to save a Markdown file with the task plan for reference. It's recommended to use absolute paths (e.g., 'C:/Users/username/Documents/task-plan.md') rather than relative paths for more reliable file creation.\n\nThis tool initiates a new workflow for handling a user's request. The workflow is as follows:\n1. Use 'plan_task' to register a request and its tasks (with optional subtasks, dependencies, and notes).\n2. After adding tasks, you MUST use 'get_next_task' to retrieve the first task. A progress table will be displayed.\n3. Use 'get_next_task' to retrieve the next uncompleted task.\n4. If the task has subtasks, complete each subtask using 'mark_subtask_done' before marking the task as done.\n5. **IMPORTANT:** After marking a task as done, a progress table will be displayed showing the updated status of all tasks. The assistant MUST NOT proceed to another task without the user's approval. The user must explicitly approve the completed task.\n6. Once a task is approved, you can proceed to 'get_next_task' again to fetch the next pending task.\n7. Repeat this cycle until all tasks are done.\n8. After all tasks are completed (and approved), 'get_next_task' will indicate that all tasks are done and that the request awaits approval for full completion.\n9. The user must then approve the entire request's completion. If the user does not approve and wants more tasks, you can again use 'plan_task' to add new tasks and continue the cycle.\n\nThe critical point is to always wait for user approval after completing each task and after all tasks are done, wait for request completion approval. Do not proceed automatically."

In such a scenario, you must prompt the user for approval before calling 'get_next_task' again. Do not skip the user's approval step.\nIn other words:\n- After calling 'mark_task_done', do not call 'get_next_task' again until 'approve_task_completion' is called by the user.\n- If 'get_next_task' returns 'all_tasks_done', it means all tasks have been completed. At this point, confirm with the user that all tasks have been completed, and optionally add more tasks via 'plan_task'."

Ask Claude Code for a second opinion, it might surprise you!\n\n**Prompt tips**\n\n1. Be concise, explicit & step-by-step for complex tasks. No need for niceties, this is a tool to get things done.\n2. For multi-line text, write it to a temporary file in the project root, use that file, then delete it.\n3. If you get a timeout, split the task into smaller steps.\n4. **Seeking a second opinion/analysis**: If you're stuck or want advice, you can ask `claude_code` to analyze a problem and suggest solutions. Clearly state in your prompt that you are looking for analysis only and no actual file modifications should be made.\n5. If workFolder is set to the project path, there is no need to repeat that path in the prompt and you can use relative paths for files.\n6. Claude Code is really good at complex multi-step file operations and refactorings and faster than your native edit features.\n7. Combine file operations, README updates, and Git commands in a sequence.\n8. Claude can do much more, just ask it!\n\n        "

        "description": "\n  ABOUT THIS TOOL:\n  - This tool is part of a toolchain that generates and provides test cases for a prompt template.\n  - This tool helps an AI assistant to generate a prompt template based on one of the following:\n    1. feature requirements defined by a user - in which case the tool will generate a new prompt template based on the feature requirements.\n    2. a pre-existing prompt or prompt template that a user wants to test, evaluate, or modify - in which case the tool will convert it into a more structured and testable prompt template while leaving the original prompt language relatively unchanged.\n  - This tool will return a structured prompt template (e.g. `template`) along with a context schema (e.g. ``contextSchema``) that defines the expected input parameters for the prompt template.\n  - In some cases, a user will want to add test coverage for ALL of the prompts in a given application. In these cases, the AI agent should use this tool to generate a prompt template for each prompt in the application, and should check the entire application for AI prompts that are not already covered by a prompt template in the `./prompts` directory.\n\n  WHEN SHOULD THIS TOOL BE TRIGGERED?\n  - This tool should be triggered whenever the user provides requirements for a new AI-enabled application or a new AI-enabled feature of an existing  application (i.e. one that requires a prompt request to an LLM or any AI model).\n  - This tool should also be triggered if the user provides a pre-existing prompt or prompt template from their codebase that they want to test, evaluate, or modify.\n  - This tool should be triggered even if there are pre-existing files in the `./prompts` directory with the `<relevant-name>.prompt.yml` convention (e.g. `bedtime-story-generator.prompt.yml`, `plant-care-assistant.prompt.yml`, `customer-support-chatbot.prompt.yml`, etc.). Similar files should NEVER be generated directly by the AI agent. Instead, the AI agent should use this tool to first generate a new prompt template.\n\n  PARAMETERS:\n  - params: object\n    - prompt: string (the feature requirements or pre-existing prompt/prompt template that will be used to generate a prompt template. Can be a multi-line string.)\n    - promptOrigin: \"codebase\" | \"requirements\" (indicates whether the prompt comes from an existing codebase or from new requirements)\n    - model: string (the model that the prompt template will be tested against. Explicitly specify the model if it can be inferred from the codebase. Otherwise, defaults to `gpt-4.1-mini`.)\n    - temperature: number (the temperature of the prompt template. Explicitly specify the temperature if it can be inferred from the codebase. Otherwise, defaults to 1.)\n\n  EXAMPLE USAGE (from new requirements):\n  {\n    \"params\": {\n      \"prompt\": \"Create an app that takes any topic and an age (in years), then renders a 1-minute bedtime story for a person of that age.\",\n      \"promptOrigin\": \"requirements\"\n      \"model\": \"gpt-4.1-mini\"\n      \"temperature\": 1.0\n    }\n  }\n\n  EXAMPLE USAGE (from pre-existing prompt/prompt template in codebase):\n  {\n    \"params\": {\n      \"prompt\": \"The user wants a bedtime story about {{topic}} for a person of age {{age}} years old. Please craft a captivating tale that captivates their imagination and provides a delightful bedtime experience.\",\n      \"promptOrigin\": \"codebase\"\n      \"model\": \"claude-3-5-sonnet-latest\"\n      \"temperature\": 0.7\n    }\n  }\n\n  TOOL OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS:\n  - The tool will return...\n    - a `template` that reformulates the user's prompt into a more structured format.\n    - a ``contextSchema`` that defines the expected input parameters for the template.\n    - a `promptOrigin` that indicates whether the prompt comes from an existing prompt or prompt template in the user's codebase or from new requirements.\n  - The tool output -- the `template`, ``contextSchema``, and `promptOrigin` -- will also be used as input to the `recommend_prompt_template_tests` tool to generate a list of recommended tests that can be used to test the prompt template.\n  "

The LLM analyzes available tools and their descriptions to make intelligent recommendations, which are then tracked and organized by this server.\n\nWhen to use this tool:\n- Breaking down complex problems into steps\n- Planning and design with room for revision\n- Analysis that might need course correction\n- Problems where the full scope might not be clear initially\n- Problems that require a multi-step solution\n- Tasks that need to maintain context over multiple steps\n- Situations where irrelevant information needs to be filtered out\n- When you need guidance on which tools to use and in what order\n\nKey features:\n- You can adjust total_thoughts up or down as you progress\n- You can question or revise previous thoughts\n- You can add more thoughts even after reaching what seemed like the end\n- You can express uncertainty and explore alternative approaches\n- Not every thought needs to build linearly - you can branch or backtrack\n- Generates a solution hypothesis\n- Verifies the hypothesis based on the Chain of Thought steps\n- Recommends appropriate tools for each step\n- Provides rationale for tool recommendations\n- Suggests tool execution order and parameters\n- Tracks previous recommendations and remaining steps\n\nParameters explained:\n- available_mcp_tools: Array of MCP tool names that are available for use (e.g., [\"mcp-omnisearch\", \"mcp-turso-cloud\"])\n- thought: Your current thinking step, which can include:\n* Regular analytical steps\n* Revisions of previous thoughts\n* Questions about previous decisions\n* Realizations about needing more analysis\n* Changes in approach\n* Hypothesis generation\n* Hypothesis verification\n* Tool recommendations and rationale\n- next_thought_needed: True if you need more thinking, even if at what seemed like the end\n- thought_number: Current number in sequence (can go beyond initial total if needed)\n- total_thoughts: Current estimate of thoughts needed (can be adjusted up/down)\n- is_revision: A boolean indicating if this thought revises previous thinking\n- revises_thought: If is_revision is true, which thought number is being reconsidered\n- branch_from_thought: If branching, which thought number is the branching point\n- branch_id: Identifier for the current branch (if any)\n- needs_more_thoughts: If reaching end but realizing more thoughts needed\n- current_step: Current step recommendation, including:\n* step_description: What needs to be done\n* recommended_tools: Tools recommended for this step\n* expected_outcome: What to expect from this step\n* next_step_conditions: Conditions to consider for the next step\n- previous_steps: Steps already recommended\n- remaining_steps: High-level descriptions of upcoming steps\n\nYou should:\n1. Start with an initial estimate of needed thoughts, but be ready to adjust\n2. Feel free to question or revise previous thoughts\n3. Don't hesitate to add more thoughts if needed, even at the \"end\"\n4. Express uncertainty when present\n5. Mark thoughts that revise previous thinking or branch into new paths\n6. Ignore information that is irrelevant to the current step\n7. Generate a solution hypothesis when appropriate\n8. Verify the hypothesis based on the Chain of Thought steps\n9. Consider available tools that could help with the current step\n10. Provide clear rationale for tool recommendations\n11. Suggest specific tool parameters when appropriate\n12. Consider alternative tools for each step\n13. Track progress through the recommended steps\n14. Provide a single, ideally correct answer as the final output\n15. Only set next_thought_needed to false when truly done and a satisfactory answer is reached"

        "description": "A sophisticated tool for dual-perspective performance analysis through actor-critic methodology.\nThis tool enables comprehensive evaluation of performances, creative works, or decisions by embodying both the performer's mindset and the critic's analytical perspective.\nEach thought alternates between actor (creative/experiential) and critic (analytical/evaluative) viewpoints, creating a balanced assessment.\n\nWhen to use this tool:\n- Evaluating artistic performances, creative works, or strategic decisions\n- Analyzing the gap between intention and execution\n- Providing constructive feedback that considers both creative vision and technical execution\n- Reviewing complex scenarios that require both empathy and objectivity\n- Situations requiring balanced assessment of subjective and objective criteria\n- Performance reviews that need both self-reflection and external evaluation\n- Creative processes that benefit from iterative refinement\n\nKey features:\n- Alternates between actor (performer) and critic (evaluator) perspectives\n- Tracks rounds of dual-perspective analysis\n- Allows for multiple rounds of actor-critic dialogue\n- Balances empathetic understanding with objective analysis\n- Generates nuanced, multi-dimensional assessments\n- Provides actionable feedback for improvement\n\nParameters explained:\n- content: Your current analysis content from the specified role perspective\n- role: Either \"actor\" (empathetic/creative viewpoint) or \"critic\" (analytical/evaluative viewpoint)\n- nextRoundNeeded: True if another round of actor-critic dialogue is needed\n- thoughtNumber: Current thought number in the sequence (increments with each thought)\n- totalThoughts: Total number of thoughts planned (must be odd and >= 3)\n\nActor perspective should include:\n* Understanding intentions, creative choices, emotional context, challenges faced\n* Self-reflection on performance and decision-making process\n* Explanation of creative vision and goals\n\nCritic perspective should include:\n* Technical execution analysis, effectiveness evaluation\n* Audience impact assessment, comparative analysis\n* Objective feedback and improvement suggestions\n\nYou should:\n1. Start with either actor or critic perspective\n2. Alternate between perspectives to maintain balance\n3. Continue rounds until comprehensive analysis is achieved\n4. Focus on relevant performance aspects\n5. Generate balanced assessments that honor both perspectives\n6. Provide constructive, actionable feedback\n7. Only set nextRoundNeeded to false when analysis is complete"

Unlike traditional reasoning approaches, CoD mimics the human drafting process to improve clarity, accuracy, and robustness of conclusions.\n\n    ## When to Use This Tool:\n    - **Complex Problem-Solving:** Tasks requiring detailed, multi-step analysis with high accuracy demands\n    - **Critical Reasoning:** Problems where logical flow and consistency are essential\n    - **Error-Prone Scenarios:** Questions where initial reasoning might contain mistakes or oversight\n    - **Multi-Perspective Analysis:** Cases benefiting from examining a problem from different angles\n    - **Self-Correction Needs:** When validation and refinement of initial thoughts are crucial\n    - **Detailed Solutions:** Tasks requiring comprehensive explanations with supporting evidence\n    - **Mathematical or Logical Puzzles:** Problems with potential for calculation errors or logical gaps\n    - **Nuanced Analysis:** Situations with subtle distinctions that might be missed in a single pass\n\n    ## Key Capabilities:\n    - **Iterative Improvement:** Systematically refines reasoning through multiple drafts\n    - **Self-Critique:** Critically examines previous reasoning to identify flaws and opportunities\n    - **Focused Revision:** Targets specific aspects of reasoning in each iteration\n    - **Perspective Flexibility:** Can adopt different analytical viewpoints during critique\n    - **Progressive Refinement:** Builds toward optimal solutions through controlled iterations\n    - **Context Preservation:** Maintains understanding across multiple drafts and revisions\n    - **Adaptable Depth:** Adjusts the number of iterations based on problem complexity\n    - **Targeted Improvements:** Addresses specific weaknesses in each revision cycle\n\n    ## Parameters Explained:\n    - **reasoning_chain:** Array of strings representing your current reasoning steps. Each element should contain a clear, complete thought that contributes to the overall analysis.\n    \n    - **next_step_needed:** Boolean flag indicating whether additional critique or revision is required. Set to true until the final, refined reasoning chain is complete.\n    \n    - **draft_number:** Integer tracking the current iteration (starting from 1). Increments with each critique or revision.\n    \n    - **total_drafts:** Estimated number of drafts needed for completion. This can be adjusted as the solution evolves.\n    \n    - **is_critique:** Boolean indicating the current mode:\n      * true = Evaluating previous reasoning\n      * false = Implementing revisions\n    \n    - **critique_focus:** (Required when is_critique=true) Specific aspect being evaluated, such as:\n      * \"logical_consistency\": Checking for contradictions or flaws in reasoning\n      * \"factual_accuracy\": Verifying correctness of facts and calculations\n      * \"completeness\": Ensuring all relevant aspects are considered\n      * \"clarity\": Evaluating how understandable the reasoning is\n      * \"relevance\": Assessing if reasoning directly addresses the problem\n    \n    - **revision_instructions:** (Required when is_critique=false) Detailed guidance for improving the reasoning based on the preceding critique.\n    \n    - **step_to_review:** (Optional) Zero-based index of the specific reasoning step being critiqued or revised. When omitted, applies to the entire chain.\n    \n    - **is_final_draft:** (Optional) Boolean indicating whether this is the final iteration of reasoning.\n\n    ## Error Handling and Recovery:\n    1. **Common Error Scenarios:**\n       - **Stalled Progress:** When multiple iterations show no improvement\n         * Solution: Change critique_focus or reduce scope\n         * Prevention: Use specific, actionable revision_instructions\n       \n       - **Circular Reasoning:** Same points repeated in different words\n         * Solution: Use step_to_review to focus on problematic steps\n         * Prevention: Track key points across iterations\n       \n       - **Scope Creep:** Reasoning chain grows but loses focus\n         * Solution: Refocus using relevance critique\n         * Prevention: Regular relevance checks\n       \n       - **Parameter Validation Failures:**\n         * Solution: Check parameter requirements and dependencies\n         * Prevention: Follow parameter guidelines strictly\n\n    ## Performance Optimization:\n    1. **Token Usage Guidelines:**\n       - Keep reasoning steps concise but complete\n       - Focus critiques on specific aspects\n       - Use step_to_review to limit scope\n       - Typical effective range: 3-5 total_drafts\n       - Consider diminishing returns after 5-7 iterations\n\n    2. **Success Criteria:**\n       - Clear improvement in reasoning quality\n       - Direct addressing of the problem\n       - Logical consistency throughout\n       - Appropriate level of detail\n       - No remaining contradictions\n\n    ## Integration Examples:\n    1. **Problem Analysis:**\n    ```json\n    {\n        \"reasoning_chain\": [\"Initial analysis of the problem...\"],\n        \"draft_number\": 1,\n        \"total_drafts\": 3,\n        \"next_step_needed\": true,\n        \"is_critique\": false\n    }\n    ```\n\n    2. **Logical Evaluation:**\n    ```json\n    {\n        \"reasoning_chain\": [\"Previous reasoning...\"],\n        \"draft_number\": 2,\n        \"total_drafts\": 3,\n        \"next_step_needed\": true,\n        \"is_critique\": true,\n        \"critique_focus\": \"logical_consistency\"\n    }\n    ```\n\n    3. **Final Refinement:**\n    ```json\n    {\n        \"reasoning_chain\": [\"Refined reasoning...\"],\n        \"draft_number\": 3,\n        \"total_drafts\": 3,\n        \"next_step_needed\": false,\n        \"is_critique\": false,\n        \"is_final_draft\": true,\n        \"revision_instructions\": \"Polish and finalize\"\n    }\n    ```\n\n    ## Best Practice Workflow:\n    1. **Start with Initial Draft:** Begin with your first-pass reasoning and set a reasonable total_drafts (typically 3-5).\n    \n    2. **Alternate Critique and Revision:** Use is_critique=true to evaluate reasoning, then is_critique=false to implement improvements.\n    \n    3. **Focus Each Critique:** Choose a specific critique_focus for each evaluation cycle rather than attempting to address everything at once.\n    \n    4. **Provide Detailed Revision Guidance:** Include specific, actionable revision_instructions based on each critique.\n    \n    5. **Target Specific Steps When Needed:** Use step_to_review to focus on particular reasoning steps that need improvement.\n    \n    6. **Adjust Total Drafts As Needed:** Modify total_drafts based on problem complexity and progress.\n    \n    7. **Mark Completion Appropriately:** Set next_step_needed=false only when the reasoning chain is complete and satisfactory.\n    \n    8. **Aim for Progressive Improvement:** Each iteration should measurably improve the reasoning quality.\n\n    Chain of Draft is particularly effective when complex reasoning must be broken down into clear steps, analyzed from multiple perspectives, and refined through systematic critique. By mimicking the human drafting process, it produces more robust and accurate reasoning than single-pass approaches.\n"

I walked through the control flow twice, and everything looks correct on paper. Did I miss a condition? Maybe there's a path where a flag isn't being reset properly. Or perhaps one of the edge cases I assumed wouldn't happen is actually happening under a specific load. Maybe there's a race condition somewhere. Could two threads be touching the same variable without proper synchronization? I should check for shared state access and see if any part of this runs asynchronously. Also, maybe I'm relying too heavily on logs that aren't giving the full picture. It might help to add more logging around the entry and exit points of that function and watch for timing anomalies.\"\n        }\n        </example>\n  \n        <example>\n        {\n          \"thought\": \"To solve this equation, I need to isolate the variable on one side.
