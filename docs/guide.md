## How to submit new packages?

> 📖 **For detailed submission instructions**, including all available configuration fields, remote MCP server setup, and OAuth 2.1 authentication, please see our [Contributing Guide](../CONTRIBUTING.md).

To submit a new package, navigate to the [packages directory](../packages/) which contains categorized subdirectories for different types of MCP servers.

```
packages/
├── uncategorized/
├── art-and-culture/
├── databases/
└── ...
```

Select the appropriate category and fill in a configuration.

The format for the configuration is as follows; this is the format of the JSON configuration:

```json
{
  "type": "mcp-server",
  "name": "GitHub MCP Server",
  "packageName": "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github",
  "description": "MCP server for using the GitHub API",
  "url": "https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/blob/main/src/github",
  "runtime": "node",
  "license": "MIT",
  "env": {
    "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN": {
      "description": "Personal access token for GitHub API access",
      "required": true
    }
  }
}
```

### Remote MCP Server Example

For MCP servers that support remote hosting with OAuth 2.1 authentication:

```json
{
  "type": "mcp-server",
  "name": "Remote GitHub MCP",
  "packageName": "github-mcp",
  "description": "GitHub MCP with remote hosting and OAuth support",
  "url": "https://github.com/example/github-mcp",
  "runtime": "node",
  "license": "MIT",
  "env": {},
  "remotes": [
    {
      "type": "streamable-http",
      "url": "https://mcp.example.com/github",
      "auth": {
        "type": "oauth2"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

For example, if you want to submit an MCP server package using an official GitHub MCP server, create a file named `modelcontextprotocol-github.json` in the `packages/code-execution` directory.

Every file that enters this repository will be validated by Zod. You can open [common-schema.ts](../src/shared/schemas/common-schema.ts) to see the definition of the Zod schema.

## What differences about ToolSDK.ai MCP Servers

Currently, there are numerous MCP-related registry platforms available in the market, such as mcp.so and Smithery.

However, mcp.so lacks an open API interface and functions primarily as a unified, aggregated hosting platform.

In contrast, Smithery.ai has modified certain official MCP servers to create a more convenient hosting solution tailored to its needs.

Projects like toolsdk-mcp-servers are also noteworthy, as it showcase many MCP servers in a README format.

However, the information is presented in an unstructured manner, making it impossible to index via an API; users must download the entries individually.

ToolSDK.ai's MCP Server Registry aims to establish a free and open community for collaboratively building an MCP server registry.

Anyone can contribute MCP configuration files through community pull requests, which will automatically generate a README file, thereby facilitating the collective maintenance and innovation of the MCP ecosystem.

It has the following features:

- **Structure JSON Config**: The configuration of the registry structure using JSON files. It enables the definition of categories, tools, and their relationships in a structured format.
- **Auto README Generation**: Automates the generation of README files for each category and tool in the registry. It ensures that the documentation is always up-to-date and consistent across the registry.

## Config

- `config/categories.mjs` - Category definitions
- `config/featured.mjs` - Featured packages list
- `config/hosting-blacklist.mjs` - Packages excluded from hosting
- `config/verified.mjs` - Verified packages list

## Scripts

```bash
# Generate the indexes
bun ./scripts/indexing-lists.ts

# Generate the README
bun ./scripts/readme-gen.ts
```
