## 1. 🧰 Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure your development environment meets the following requirements:

- **Docker** (recommended) - For quick start deployment
- **Node.js** >= 18.x (latest LTS version recommended) - Required for local development only
- **pnpm** >= 8.x (package manager) - Required for local development only

## 2. 🧰 Tech Stack

- **Runtime Environment**: Node.js (ESM modules)
- **Package Manager**: pnpm
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Web Framework**: Hono.js + OpenAPI (Zod)
- **Architecture**: Domain-Driven Design (DDD) + Service Object Pattern
- **Search Service**: MeiliSearch (optional)
- **Sandbox Providers**: LOCAL / Sandock / Daytona / E2B
- **Build Tool**: TypeScript Compiler (tsc)
- **Code Formatting**: Biome
- **Testing**: Vitest

## 3. 🎯 Project Purpose

This project has two main purposes:

1. **MCP Registry** - Collects and indexes various MCP servers, providing search functionality
2. **MCP Server** - Deployed as a server to remotely call various MCP servers

### Key Features:

- 📦 **Package Management** - Registry of 6000+ MCP servers with metadata and validation
- 🔍 **Search Service** - Full-text search powered by MeiliSearch (optional)
- 🛡️ **Sandbox Execution** - Secure MCP tool execution in isolated environments:
  - **LOCAL** - Direct local execution (default)
  - **Sandock** - Lightweight Docker sandbox for AI agents
  - **Daytona** - Cloud development environments
  - **E2B** - Code interpreter sandbox
- 🌐 **RESTful API** - Complete API with OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
- ⚡ **Performance** - Async execution with connection pooling

Additionally, we have deployed a website [ToolSDK.ai](https://toolsdk.ai) that can search for and run MCP Servers. We also provide a tool called `toolsdk` to help integrate these MCP Servers.

## 4. 🚀 Quick Start with Docker

Docker Compose allows you to quickly deploy the complete MCP Registry with search functionality and SANDOCK remote execution environment.

### 4.1 Quick Start (5 Minutes)

**Step 1: Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/toolsdk-ai/toolsdk-mcp-registry.git
cd toolsdk-mcp-registry
```

**Step 2: Get Sandock API Key**

Visit [Sandock website](https://sandock.ai) to register and obtain your API Key.

**Step 3: Configure Environment Variables**

In the `.env` file, you only need to modify this line:

```env
SANDOCK_API_KEY=your-sandock-api-key-here  # Replace with your actual API Key
```

**Step 4: Start Services**

```bash
docker compose up -d
# Or use the shortcut:
make up
```

> **⚠️ Note:** This command will build and install all 6000+ MCP packages and their dependencies, which may take 10-15 minutes on first run. If you only need specific packages for your use case, consider pruning unwanted packages first by following the guide in [Section 5: Package Management for Private Deployment](#5--package-management-for-private-deployment) to significantly reduce build time and image size.
>
> **Common Docker commands:**
> - `make up` or `docker compose up -d` - Start all services
> - `make down` or `docker compose down` - Stop all services
> - `make restart` or `docker compose restart` - Restart all services

This will start two services:
- `mcp-registry` - MCP Registry main application (port 3003)
- `meilisearch` - Search engine service (port 7700)

**Step 5: Initialize Search Index (Optional)**

Wait for services to start (about 30-60 seconds), then initialize the search index:

```bash
# Initialize search service
curl -X POST http://localhost:3003/api/v1/search/manage/init

# Index MCP data
curl -X POST http://localhost:3003/api/v1/search/manage/index
```

**Step 6: Access Services**

- 🌐 Homepage: http://localhost:3003
- 📚 API Documentation: http://localhost:3003/swagger
- 🔍 Search Engine Management: http://localhost:7700

### 4.2 API Usage Examples

**List all MCP Servers:**

```bash
curl http://localhost:3003/api/v1/packages
```

**Search MCP Servers:**

```bash
curl "http://localhost:3003/api/v1/search/packages?q=github&limit=5"
```

**Execute MCP Tool (using SANDOCK remote execution):**

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3003/api/v1/packages/run \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "packageName": "mcp-starter",
    "toolKey": "hello_tool",
    "inputData": {
      "name": "World"
    },
    "envs": {}
  }'
```

### 4.3 Troubleshooting

**Issue 1: Port Already in Use**

```bash
# Check port usage
lsof -i :3003
lsof -i :7700

# Modify port in .env file
MCP_SERVER_PORT=3004
```

**Issue 2: SANDOCK_API_KEY Not Configured**

Error message:
```
Error: SANDOCK_API_KEY is required when using SANDOCK provider
```

Solution:
- Check if `.env` file exists
- Confirm `SANDOCK_API_KEY` is correctly filled in
- Restart services: `docker compose restart`

**Issue 3: Search Function Unavailable**

```bash
# Check if MeiliSearch is running
docker compose ps meilisearch

# Reinitialize indexes
curl -X POST http://localhost:3003/api/v1/search/manage/init
curl -X POST http://localhost:3003/api/v1/search/manage/index
```

**Issue 4: Long Build Time**

First build may take 10-15 minutes, which is normal. The Dockerfile needs to:
- Install Python 3.13 and pyenv
- Install Node.js dependencies (large number of packages)
- Install Python dependencies
- Build TypeScript code

Subsequent builds will be much faster using Docker cache.

## 5. 📦 Package Management for Private Deployment

If you're deploying this project privately, you probably don't need all 6000+ MCP packages. Here's how to keep only the packages you need to significantly reduce build time and dependencies.

### 5.1 Understanding Package Structure

All MCP packages are stored in the `packages/` directory, organized by category:

```
packages/
├── developer-tools/      # Development related tools
├── databases/            # Database integrations
├── cloud-platforms/      # Cloud service integrations
├── version-control/      # Git, GitHub, etc.
├── communication/        # Slack, Discord, etc.
└── ...                   # 30+ other categories
```

Each package is defined by a JSON configuration file.

### 5.2 How to Remove Unwanted Packages

**Option 1: Remove Specific Packages**

To remove individual packages within a category, simply delete their JSON configuration files:

1. Navigate to the category folder (e.g., `packages/version-control/`)
2. Delete the `.json` files for packages you don't need
3. Run the rebuild process (see Section 5.3)

Example: Keep only GitHub-related packages in version-control by removing other `.json` files like `gitlab.json`, `bitbucket.json`, etc.

**Option 2: Remove Entire Categories**

To remove entire categories (e.g., gaming, sports), edit the `config/categories.mjs` file:

1. Open `config/categories.mjs`
2. Remove the category objects you don't need. For example, to remove gaming and sports:

```javascript
// Remove these entries from the array:
{
  key: "gaming",
  name: "Gaming",
  description: "Connect with gaming data, engines, and related services.",
},
{
  key: "sports",
  name: "Sports",
  description: "Access sports data, results, and stats with ease.",
}
```

3. Run the rebuild process - the build script will automatically remove the corresponding directories and their packages

**Option 3: Keep Only What You Need (Minimal Setup)**

For a minimal deployment with only essential categories:

1. Open `config/categories.mjs`
2. Remove all category entries except the ones you need (e.g., `developer-tools`, `databases`, `cloud-platforms`, `version-control`, `communication`, `file-systems`)
3. Run the rebuild process

This approach is recommended as it ensures consistency between your configuration and the actual packages.

### 5.3 Rebuild Indexes

After removing packages, rebuild the indexes:

**For Linux/macOS:**

```bash
make build
```

**For Windows:**

The `make` command is not available by default on Windows. You'll need to run the build commands manually. Open the `Makefile` file in the project root and execute the commands in the `build` target one by one:

```bash
bun scripts/cat-dirs.ts
pnpm install --no-frozen-lockfile
bun scripts/indexing-lists.ts
bun scripts/check-config.ts
pnpm install --no-frozen-lockfile
npx tsx scripts/test-mcp-clients.ts
pnpm install --no-frozen-lockfile
pnpm prune
bun scripts/readme-gen.ts
pnpm run sort
pnpm run check
pnpm run build
```

This will:
- Scan the remaining packages in `packages/` directory
- Validate them and install only required dependencies
- Generate new indexes in `indexes/`
- Update `package.json` with only the necessary Node.js dependencies

### 5.4 Benefits of Package Pruning

By keeping only the packages you need, you'll get:

- ✅ **Faster Build Time** - From 10-15 minutes to 2-3 minutes
- ✅ **Smaller Dependencies** - From thousands to dozens of packages
- ✅ **Smaller Docker Image** - Reduced image size by 50-80%
- ✅ **Faster Deployment** - Less data to transfer and install
- ✅ **Easier Maintenance** - Focus only on packages you actually use

### 5.5 Recommended Minimal Setup

For a typical private deployment, we recommend keeping only the most commonly used categories. 

Edit `config/categories.mjs` and keep only these essential categories:

- `developer-tools` - Development workflow tools
- `databases` - Database integrations
- `cloud-platforms` - Cloud service integrations
- `version-control` - Git, GitHub, etc.
- `communication` - Slack, Discord, etc.
- `file-systems` - File management tools

To do this, open `config/categories.mjs` and remove all other category entries (like gaming, sports, marketing, travel, etc.). After rebuilding, this will give you a practical set of ~200-300 packages instead of 6000+.

## 6. 💻 Local Development Setup

This section is for developers who want to contribute to the project or need faster development iteration.

**When to use local development:**
- Contributing code to the project
- Debugging and testing changes with fast reload
- Developing new features

**Quick command reference:**
- `make build` - Build the project and install dependencies
- `make search` - Start MeiliSearch container (for search functionality)
- `make dev` - Start the development server with hot reload

### 6.1 Install Dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

### 6.2 Build Project

```bash
make build
```

This will perform the following operations:
- Validate all MCP server configurations
- Install all necessary dependencies
- Build TypeScript code

### 6.3 Start Development Server (Without Search Function)

This is the simplest way to start, suitable for scenarios where only API functionality is needed:

1. Ensure `ENABLE_SEARCH=false` is set in the `.env` file:

```env
ENABLE_SEARCH=false
MCP_SERVER_PORT=3003
```

2. Start the development server:

```bash
make dev
```

3. Access the following endpoints:
   - API Documentation: http://localhost:3003/swagger

### 6.4 Start Development Server (With Search Function)

If you need full search functionality:

1. Set up the `.env` file:

```env
ENABLE_SEARCH=true
MCP_SERVER_PORT=3003
MEILI_HTTP_ADDR=http://localhost:7700
```

2. Start the MeiliSearch service (only the search container):

```bash
make search
```

This command starts only the MeiliSearch container for local development. The main application will be run separately with `make dev`.

3. Build the project and start the development server:

```bash
make build
make dev
```

4. Initialize search indexes:

Call the following endpoints via API:
- `POST /api/v1/search/manage/init` - Initialize search service
- `POST /api/v1/search/manage/index` - Index data

5. Access:
   - Search Page: http://localhost:3003
   - API Documentation: http://localhost:3003/swagger

## 7. 🛠 Common Issues and Troubleshooting

### 7.1 MCP Client Test Errors During Build Process

When executing the `make build` command, you may see error messages similar to the following:

```
Error reading MCP Client for package: claude-prompts... ENOENT: no such file or directory
```

**This is normal!** The reason for these errors is:

- This project includes thousands of MCP packages
- The build process attempts to test all packages through the [test-mcp-clients.ts](file:///root/vika/toolsdk-mcp-registry/scripts/test-mcp-clients.ts) script
- Due to the large number, the testing process may take several hours
- Not all packages need to be installed and tested, as most packages are not essential for running the registry

**These errors can be ignored as long as the build process continues to execute.** After the build is complete, you can still use the API and search functionality (if search is enabled) normally.

## 8. 🗃️ Project Structure

This project follows **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** architecture with **Service Object** pattern:

```

### Architecture Highlights:

- **Service Object (SO) Pattern**: Business logic encapsulated in reusable Service Objects
- **Handler Layer**: Thin HTTP request/response handlers
- **Repository Pattern**: Data access abstraction
- **Factory Pattern**: Dynamic object creation (Executor, Sandbox providers)
- **Dependency Injection**: Loose coupling through constructor injection

## 9. ⚙️ Environment Variables

### Quick Configuration (Only 1 Variable Required)

For Docker deployment, you only need to configure **`SANDOCK_API_KEY`**:

```env
# 🔑 Required: Get it from https://sandock.ai
SANDOCK_API_KEY=your-sandock-api-key-here
```

All other configurations have reasonable default values and do not need to be modified.

### Optional Configuration

All environment variables are managed centrally through `src/shared/config/environment.ts`.

## 10. 🔐 OAuth Integration

This section explains how to integrate OAuth authentication for MCP servers that require user authorization (e.g., GitHub, Slack, etc.).

### 10.1 Overview

The Registry encapsulates OAuth protocol complexity (Discovery/DCR/PKCE). Third-party platforms only need to implement the following standard flow to replace the demo implementation:

**Flow Summary:**
1. **Prepare** - Initiate authorization and get auth URL
2. **Callback** - Receive tokens after user authorization
3. **Run** - Execute tools with access token
4. **Refresh** - Refresh expired tokens

### 10.2 Step 1: Initiate Authorization (Prepare)

**Endpoint:** `POST {REGISTRY_URL}/api/v1/oauth/prepare`

**Request:**
```json
{
  "packageName": "github-mcp",
  "callbackBaseUrl": "https://api.your-platform.com/internal/mcp-oauth/complete"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "authUrl": "https://github.com/login/oauth/authorize?...",
  "sessionId": "session-uuid-here"
}
```

**Implementation:**
- Retrieve `authUrl` and `sessionId` from the response
- Frontend redirects user via `window.open(authUrl)` to initiate third-party login

### 10.3 Step 2: Receive Credentials (Callback)

**Mechanism:** After user authorization, Registry will automatically **POST** data to the `callbackBaseUrl` provided in Step 1.

**Received Data:**
```json
{
  "sessionId": "session-uuid-here",
  "tokens": {
    "access_token": "gho_xxxx",
    "refresh_token": "ghr_xxxx",
    "expires_in": 28800
  },
  "clientInfo": {
    "client_id": "Iv1.xxxx"
  }
}
```

**Implementation:**
- Your backend must implement this callback endpoint
- Receive and persist the tokens, associating them with the current user
- **Important:** Registry does NOT store tokens - your platform is responsible for token storage

### 10.4 Step 3: Execute Tools (Run)

**Endpoint:** `POST {REGISTRY_URL}/api/v1/packages/run`

**Request:**
```json
{
  "packageName": "github-mcp",
  "toolKey": "list_repositories",
  "inputData": {
    "owner": "toolsdk-ai"
  },
  "accessToken": "gho_xxxx"
}
```

**Implementation:**
- Add `accessToken` field to the existing request body
- Registry automatically injects the token into MCP Server request headers

### 10.5 Step 4: Refresh Token

**Endpoint:** `POST {REGISTRY_URL}/api/v1/oauth/refresh`

**Request:**
```json
{
  "packageName": "github-mcp",
  "refreshToken": "ghr_xxxx",
  "clientId": "Iv1.xxxx"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "access_token": "gho_new_xxxx",
  "refresh_token": "ghr_new_xxxx",
  "expires_in": 28800
}
```

**Implementation:**
- When tokens expire, use stored `refreshToken` and `clientId` to obtain new tokens
- Update stored tokens with the new values
