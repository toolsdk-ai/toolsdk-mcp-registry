Want to add a new MCP server to our registry? It's easy! Just follow these steps:

1. **Fork this repo** 🍴 - Click the fork button at the top right of this page
2. **Create a JSON file** 📄 - Add a new file named `your-mcp-server.json` in the [packages/uncategorized](./packages/uncategorized) folder. AI will automatically categorize it later.
3. **Fill in the details** ✍️ - Use the format below.
4. **Submit a pull request** 🚀 - We'll review it and merge it in!

If you know which category your server fits into, feel free to put it in the appropriate folder instead of `uncategorized`.
